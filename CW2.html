<p align="center" style="font-size:25px;"> I'm unclear what you want me to do because all you said was to add a style sheet property to the example to change the text to dark red so I will just do that to the second line for in-line and embedded.
<h2 align="center"> In-line Style</h2>
<p style="text-indent:2cm; color:red; font-size:25px;" align="center">
This paragraph has been formatted using the in-line style command.

This paragraph has been formatted using the in-line style command to Dark Red.

<h1 align="center"> Exercise 2</h1>
<p class="font">
All the way at the top your "style" tag is "sty le"<br>
From what I can see font-family:"times new roman should be font-family: times new roman; <br>
Down towards the last command "marginleft:2cm" needs to be margin-left: 2cm; you forgot a semi-colon there

<h1 align="center"> Exercise 5</h1>
<p class="font" align="center"> Here's the link for my <a href="CW2.css" download>CSS</a> , If that's what you want? Because I did the code above using a CSS
<hr>
<h1 align="center"> Exercise 6</h1> 
<ol class="font2">
<li>This is possible by using a CSS and set all headers,body,p,li etc.. to be a specific font, size, and color etc..<br>
	This way everything would be in uniform and all the teachers would have to do is upload their items without each header or body being different</li>
<li>Just like in question one this is better because we could keep the website looking clean.<br>
	We wouldn't want the fonts to be so big or so small or this body different background then the other.</li>
<li>
	<ul>
		<li>Examples would be h1 h2 h3 their class could be like class="h1" etc.. this would set all the h1 the same</li>
		<li>Another one would be body and this I think is important because body has a lot of words in it and it would look nice if all the words would look the same. class="body"</li>
		<li>Tables would look nice if they were all in uniform. class="tables"</li>
		<li>HyperLinks is another, we can't have links be different colors. we dont need to write a class here.</li>
		<li> Can't forget the paragraph tag class="p"</li>
		<li>Captions for our tables. class="table"</li>
		<li> The imgage tag so our teachers can upload pictures. class="img"</li>
		<li> Lists like ordred and stuff like that class="ol" or class="ul"</li>
		<li> Tbody table would be define in the table class</li>
		<li> theader also would be define in table calss</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li> In the CSS if we start by writing the code i.g h1{ color:red;} then all of h1 would be red so to set everything in uniform we would do that.
So when we writing the code we could just write out the tag without the "." and in the actual html file we wouldn't have to wory about defining a class of what each tags has to do. So the teachers could just upload with ease and not have to wory about messing up the website and the website would look clean.
